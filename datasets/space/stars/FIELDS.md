# HYG Star Database Fields

Valid for both v3.x and v4.x.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | The database primary key. |
| `hip` | The star's ID in the Hipparcos catalog, if known. |
| `hd` | The star's ID in the Henry Draper catalog, if known. |
| `hr` | The star's ID in the Harvard Revised catalog, which is the same as its number in the Yale Bright Star Catalog. |
| `gl` | The star's ID in the third edition of the Gliese Catalog of Nearby Stars. |
| `bf` | The Bayer / Flamsteed designation, primarily from the Fifth Edition of the Yale Bright Star Catalog. This is a combination of the two designations. The Flamsteed number, if present, is given first; then a three-letter abbreviation for the Bayer Greek letter; the Bayer superscript number, if present; and finally, the three-letter constellation abbreviation. Thus Alpha Andromedae has the field value "21Alp And", and Kappa1 Sculptoris (no Flamsteed number) has "Kap1Scl". |
| `ra`, `dec` | The star's right ascension and declination, for epoch and equinox 2000.0. |
| `proper` | A common name for the star, such as "Barnard's Star" or "Sirius". Taken from the IAU (https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/), using a formatted version from https://github.com/mirandadam/iau-starnames. |
| `dist` | The star's distance in parsecs. To convert to light years, multiply by 3.262. A value >= 100000 indicates missing or dubious (e.g., negative) parallax data in Hipparcos. |
| `pmra`, `pmdec` | The star's proper motion in right ascension and declination, in milliarcseconds per year. |
| `rv` | The star's radial velocity in km/sec, where known. |
| `mag` | The star's apparent visual magnitude. |
| `absmag` | The star's absolute visual magnitude (its apparent magnitude from a distance of 10 parsecs). |
| `spect` | The star's spectral type, if known. |
| `ci` | The star's color index (blue magnitude - visual magnitude), where known. |
| `x`, `y`, `z` | Cartesian coordinates of the star, in a system based on the equatorial coordinates as seen from Earth. +X is in the direction of the vernal equinox (at epoch 2000), +Z towards the north celestial pole, and +Y in the direction of R.A. 6 hours, declination 0 degrees. |
| `vx`, `vy`, `vz` | Cartesian velocity components of the star, in the same coordinate system as x/y/z. Determined from proper motion and radial velocity (when known). The velocity unit is parsecs per year; these are small values (around 1 millionth of a parsec per year), but they enormously simplify calculations using parsecs as base units for celestial mapping. |
| `rarad`, `decrad`, `pmrarad`, `pmdecrad` | The positions in radians, and proper motions in radians per year. |
| `bayer` | The Bayer designation as a distinct value. |
| `flam` | The Flamsteed number as a distinct value. |
| `con` | The standard constellation abbreviation. |
| `comp`, `comp_primary`, `base` | Identifies a star in a multiple star system. `comp` = ID of companion star, `comp_primary` = ID of primary star for this component, and `base` = catalog ID or name for this multi-star system. Currently only used for Gliese stars. |
| `lum` | Star's luminosity as a multiple of Solar luminosity. |
| `var` | Star's standard variable star designation, when known. |
| `var_min`, `var_max` | Star's approximate magnitude range, for variables. Based on Hp magnitudes for the range in the original Hipparcos catalog, adjusted to the V magnitude scale to match the `mag` field. |
